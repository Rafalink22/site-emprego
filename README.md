Hello, my name is Bruno.

This is a new project that I have an idea to create with the guidance of some AIs. I've wanted to create a website that could help people who are currently unemployed. It works like this: there's a first page (the main page) that provides a menu for candidates with login and registration. Once they have completed the login or registration, it will unlock the menu for candidates to view the job vacancies. Some vacancies will also appear on this page. I've also created a page where employers can provide us with information to create new job openings for the candidates. Additionally, we have admin pages where we can handle candidate and vacancy data to manage when the vacancy deadlines end. So, I'm not fluent in English, so I hope you all understood me. Thanks for reading my README, have a good day!
